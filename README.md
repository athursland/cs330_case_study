## Zip Contents
Our zip file contains 4 csv files that were provided to us as part of the case study. 

 - geolife-cars.csv
 - geolife-cars-ten-percent.csv
 - geolife-cars-thirty-percent.csv
 - geolife-cars-sixty-percent.csv

It also contains the following python files:

- task1.py - this is the python file that contains the coded algorithms asked of us in task1.
- task1_viz.py - this is what you can run to see our visualizations made from the dataset provided.
- task1_tests.py - this file contains the tests that we are asked to run.
- task2.py - this is the python file that contains the coded algorithms asked of us in task2.
- task3.py - this is the python file that contains the coded algorithms asked of us in task3.

  

To reproduce our results, run task1_viz.py, then task2.py, then task3.py

 ## External Dependencies

The only external library we used is matplotlib. Make sure matplotlib is installed, or our code won't work. Install matplotlib by tying the following command in your terminal: 

    pip3 install matplotlib
